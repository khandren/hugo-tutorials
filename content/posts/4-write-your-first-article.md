## Website Pages and Content

Congratulations! Your website is actually ready to be publicly available on the Internet. But, we haven't shown you how to create your own articles/blog posts.

Earlier, when we copy-pasted the **content, layouts, static** folders and **config.yaml** file into our `myWebsite` folder, we were taking all the demo site's content, which can be found [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-cactus-plus/). So, they're not really our own content.

So the pages you see at localhost:1313 are just placeholders. We now want to change it so that we have our own content on our pages. 

Let's open our `myWebsite` Hugo project folder on a VSCode. 

If we expand the `content/posts` folder, we will see some `.md` (Markdown) files.

The way Hugo works is that each `.md` file in the folder `contents/posts` (as seen in the gif) represents a page on the actual website.

So if you want to add a new page to your website, just add a new `.md` file, and write some content in it. You do not need to write any other code, since Hugo will do the rest.
