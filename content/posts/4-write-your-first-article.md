## Add Content

Congratulations! Your website is actually ready to be publicly available on the Internet. But, we haven't shown you how to create your own articles/blog posts.

Earlier, when we copy-pasted the **content, layouts, static** folders and **config.yaml** file into our `myWebsite` folder, we were taking all the demo site's content, which can be found [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-cactus-plus/). So, they're not really our own content.

Let's open our `myWebsite` Hugo project folder on a VSCode. If we expand the `content/posts` folder, we will see some `.md` files.
