# Using a Hugo Theme

There are so many [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to choose from and they have slightly different ways to set it up depending on the one you pick. Most come with instructions on how to set them up, so be sure to check that they have setup instructions.

In this tutorial, we will use the [Mini theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cactus-plus/) for our Hugo site. 

To install the Mini theme into your Hugo project, enter the following commands in your Command Line / Terminal:

```bash
cd myWebsite
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini.git themes/mini
```

> **git init** - Initializes your myWebsite folder into a git repository. This means you will be able to store your code  on GitHub

Open your `myWebsite` folder on your computer, navigate to `themes/mini/exampleSite`.
